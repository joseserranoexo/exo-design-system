# Typography Guidelines

## Titles

### Display-1

Display-1 should be used for situations when we need to use big texts, as hero spaces or pages with special content.

![display-1](xxx)

### Headline

Normally used for **H1** texts, main title of platform sections and similar.

IMG

### Title

This text style is common for **H2** texts, for dividing text info inside a page or giving name to modules inside a page

IMG

### Subheading-2

We should use this style for subtitles of section titles (below a Headline) and **H3** texts

IMG

### Section

This kind of texts uses to show above a Headline or a Title to give them context, or as titles for side-cards (used for additional content in a page).

IMG

## Body Texts

### Body-1

Regular text por paragraphs P, the most common in platform.

IMG

### Body-2

Bold style for regular texts, to emphasize some content.

IMG

### Big-body

Sometimes we need to give a bigger size to some paragraphs, normally in special sections (as in Onboarding, for instance). We use this body text a little bit bigger for those situations.

IMG

### Caption-1

Complementary info in cards, inputs or other platform components. Also for paragraphs that complement other main ones.

IMG

### Caption-2

When we need to highlight some complementary info that have more relevance at some situations.
