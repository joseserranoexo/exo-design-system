# Typography Guidelines

## Titles

### Display-1

Display-1 should be used for situations when we need to use big texts, as hero spaces or pages with special content.

### Headline

Normally used for **H1** texts, main title of platform sections and similar.

### Title

This text style is common for **H2** texts, for dividing text info inside a page or giving name to modules inside a page

### Big-body

Sometimes we need to give a bigger size to some paragraphs, normally in special sections (as in Onboarding, for instance). We use this body text a little bit bigger for those situations.

### Caption-1

Complementary info in cards, inputs or other platform components. Also for paragraphs that complement other main ones.

### Mini-Caption

Special situations when a very small size of text it's needed, as for example complementary texts for some components where there's not too much space

Used in form components: inputs, text areas, selects...

### Link & Mention

This style adapts from the main class and gives extra attributes for let the user know that this is a link-text. Link-texts takes the user to a page using a new tab in his/her browser (in the case of mentions this is to the profile page in platform).
