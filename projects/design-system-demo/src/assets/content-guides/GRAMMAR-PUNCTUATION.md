### **Simple Tenses**
Use present simple, past simple and, in general, avoid complicated tenses.

* **Yes:** Question deleted

* **No:** ~Question has been deleted~

&nbsp;
### **Exclamation points**
Use exclamation points to be encouraging or generate excitement. Don’t use exclamation points in error messages, confirmation messages or instructional text.

* **Yes:** We are looking forward to seeing you in our summit in Johannesburg!

* **No:** ~Your changes were saved!~

&nbsp;
### **Quotation marks**
We use double quotation marks and always put periods and commas inside them.

* **Yes:** “We are living in the 4th Industrial Revolution,” Salim Ismail said.

* **No:** ~“We are living in the 4th Industrial Revolution”, Salim Ismail said.~

&nbsp;
### **Contractions**
It's fine to use contractions because it's more natural. However, avoid them in financial and very formal communications as needed. 

* **Yes:** If the provided link doesn't work, visit our page

* **No:** ~If the link does not work, visit our page~

&nbsp;
### **Active and passive voice**
We use the **active voice** (SUBJECT + VERB + OBJECT) as a general rule, since it is clear and direct.

* **Yes:** Salim Ismail published his new book.

* **No:** ~A new book was published by Salim Ismail.~


The **passive voice** can be used to generalize/make clear you are not personally responsible for a decision or action.

* **Yes:** Circles are updated with each new piece of content.

* **No:** ~We update Circles with each new piece of content.~

&nbsp;
### **Capitalization**
Certain elements need to be capitalized when used. 

**Individual job titles when mentioning a specific role.** Don't capitalize when referring to the role in general terms.
  * Jaroslav Dokoupil is the Chief Executive Officer of OpenExO
  * This is a great opportunity for chief executive officers around the world

**Institutions**
  * Singularity University
  * United Nations

**File extensions when referring to them generally** but in lowercase when referring to a specific file.
  * Upload a PDF file
  * The file ecosystemmembers.pdf does not exist

&nbsp;
### **Numbers**
Use **numerals for notification-type** communications (1, 2, 3 over one, two, three.)

* **Yes:** You have 3 new messages              
* **No:** ~You have three new messages~

For **pieces of text, articles, blog posts and announcements,** spell the number out when it is lower than 10.

* **Yes:** These were two of the most successful initiatives in 2019 in Silicon Valley             
* **No:** ~These were 2 of the most successful initiatives in 2019 in Silicon Valleys~

Numbers over 3 digits get **commas**:

* **Yes:** You have 1,000 new messages
* **No:** ~You have 1.000 new messages~

Use a dash without a space for **number ranges**:

* **Yes:** 15-20 messages
* **No:** ~15 - 20 messages~

&nbsp;
### **Links**
Use descriptive text for links so users know where they are being directed.  Never use “click here” or “here” as link text. Place the link in the specific words related to it, not the entire sentence.

* **Yes:** Find out more OpenExO articles in our [Medium page.](https://medium.com/openexo)
* **No:** ~Want to learn more about OpenExO? [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs069dndIYk)~

&nbsp;
### **Lists**
Bulleted or numbered lists are not punctuated and should never end with a period or comma, unless two separate sentences or more are included in the same bullet point.

| Yes           | No            |          
| ------------- |:-------------:|

### **Dates**
As a general rule, we follow the **European convention for dates: DD/MM/YY.**

* **Yes:** 24 February 2019.

* **No:** ~February 24, 2019~

Use the **ordinal** only when it is part of a piece of text.

* **Yes:** The 24th of February 2019 was a day we will remember, since we achieved our most important goal.

* **No:** ~February 24th, 2019 was a day we will remember, since we achieved our most important goal.~

If there are space constraints in lists, tables and forms, it is allowed to use a **3-letter abbreviation for months.** Do not combine this with abbreviated days of the week. Pieces of text like articles, blog posts and financial documents should not follow this.

* **Yes:** Feb 24, 2019.

* **No:** ~Febru 24, 2019~

### **Time**
We use **am and pm** in lowercase with a space between them and the number. We always include the minutes separated by a colon, even if it’s zero.

* **Yes:** The meeting will start at 8:00 am.

When we are talking about a **time period**, we leave no spaces and separate the times with a hyphen.

* **Yes:** 8:00am-9:30am

* **No:** ~8:00 am - 9:30 am~

If **time zones** need to be specified, write them after the am/pm indicator separated by a space and in capitals.
