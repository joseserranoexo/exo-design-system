## Introduction

The OpenExO identity system is not just a logotype and a mark. It is a system
scheme composed of a number of element that come together to create a
distinctive look and feel that makes the brand instantly recognisable. Spannig
logo applications, color usage, typographic treatment and the use of systems
– The following pages will assist you in designing and producing compelling
communications with creativity flexibility.

### Identity

The logo is the most visible element of our identity system and it is signature
across all OpenExO collateral and communications. There are rules for its
application, but we have created a system that allows freedom and flexiblity.

#### OpenExO Logo

The OpenExO logotype and logomark are the most
recognisable visual assets and must always be
implemented consistently. These various elements
should only be reproduced from artwork provided.

They must never be modified or altered. All logo
elements should be applied with consideration and
attention to detail.

LOGO IMAGE HERE

The OpenExO logotype has been created based on
a set of proportional measures between all of its
elements. By doing this, we achieve a harmonious,
balanced and solid composition. It is strictly
necessary to respect the proportions described here
to always ensure visual consistency.

#### Exclusion Zones

In order to ensure it’s correct visualization, we have
created a “safety area” in which it is prohibited to
integrate any type of graphic element (images, text,
icons, etc.)

The Various OpenExO Logo elements should never
encroach their exclusion zone. The exclusion zone
is equal to the height of the logotype, above, below
and at both sides. It creates a boundary around the
logo. At no point should this be interfered with.

EXCLUSION ZONES IMAGE HERE

#### Logo Lockup

The OpenExO Logotype can be used
interchangably and appropriately – However it is
important to note that each element anchords
itself to either center, top or bottom margin.

If you’re creating a composition, please put the
logo in one of the four corner areas, or center it on
the page.

#### Logomark Lockup

The OpenExO Logomark can be used
interchangably and appropriately – However it is
important to note that each element anchords
itself to either center, top or bottom margin.

If you’re creating a composition, please put the
logo in one of the four corner areas, or center it on
the page.

#### Minimum Sizes

Choosing a scale for the logotype to be used should
be addressed on a case by case basis so that the
OpenExO branding remains intact. The exclusion
rules apply throughout all applications in various
sizes.

The minimum width of the logotype for print is always
set to be 25mm. The minimum width of the logomark
should be 7 mm.

The minimum width of the logomark for web
applications is always set to be 100 px. The minimum
width of the logomark should be 20 px.

MINIMUM SIZES IMAGE HERE

#### Color

Where possible, the logo elements always sit in the
main brands colours.

Clarity must be maintained by making sure that there
is a contrast between the logotype and the background
it is being applied to.

The OpenExO logo should work across all media.
The style you choose will depend on the environment
in which the logo appears. To ensure the expression
of the logo is right for its context, we’ve created an
extended palette of solid colors as well as reversed
logo treatments. So whether the OpenExO logo
appears on digital applications, Web, in print, on
screen, or on a product, you have near infinite design
flexibility to adapt the logo to its appropriate design
context.

##### Extended logo palette

For more palette examples, please refer to the
following color section.

COLOR EXAMPLES IMAGE HERE

#### Extended Logo Palette

Whenever possible, we will use the logo in its main
version in positive and negative color. However, we can
use the logo with different corporate colors according
to the needs of the applications.

The palettes on the right provide an example of how
color can be infused into the logo. These are only
partial palletes. The logo accepts a wide flexibility
when it comes to using colours. Use always the full
range of brand colours.

2ND COLOR EXAMPLES IMAGE HERE

#### Background

The chosen layout and application of the logotype
should be carefully considered and the exclusion zones
taken into account when applying it to collateral. The
contrast of the logotype against the background should
be carefully considered in order to keep the visual
aesthetic of the brand intact across multiple collateral.

Applying the logo on images and non-blank pages
should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis.
It should only sit on uncluttered images or on clear
sections.

The logo should never place over a busy image,
whereby the clarity of the logotype could be
compromised.

BACKGROUND EXAMPLES IMAGE HERE

#### Misuses

To protect the quality of the OpenExO logotype
it should never be altered or misused. Here are
some examples of incorrect applications:
- Do not turn or reposition the elements
of the logotype.
- Do not distort or strech.
- Do not use a different typeface.
- Do not use visuals efects.
- Do not apply different corporate colors.
- Do not center lock up.
- Do not outline symbol or wordmark.
- Do not fill in symbol.
- Do not change the proportions.

#### Digital Files

Here is a list of all the digital files, in all different
formats, for the OpenExO logo.

The naming system used was created to easily
identify all formats. For example:

**openexo_logo_rgb.pdf**
**title_file_color.format**

##### Title

- **OpenExO**: openexo

##### Color

- **Pantone**: P
- **4 Inks**: cmyk
- **RGB**: rgb
- **Black/White**: bn

##### Format

- .eps
- .ai
- .svg
- .pdf
- .png
- .jpg
- etc

### Color Palette

Color plays an important role in establishing a distinct and consistent corporate identity. The OpenExO colour palette offers a sense of vibracy to our communications. Color used simply and with balance can communicate clarity, consistency, and modern sophistication. The OpenExO identity uses a wide
palette. You can form an infinite amount of combinations that are very clear
and very different.

#### Primary Color Palette

The OpenExO colour palette has been develop
around a core set of bright, fresh and optimistic
colours which can be used across all comunications.

We have four primary brand colors: Navy Blue, Coral,
Sunglow and Han Purple. These are the variants of
the light colors. Each color has its corresponding
dark color. These primary colors are the ones most
displayed across brand’s communication pieces.

Our brand thrives on simplicity, not excess. Please do
not use more than four brand colours within on design.

##### Light Colors

#### Secondary  Color Palette

Secondary colours provide the flexibility and
playfulness to communicate various subjects and
moods. All secondary colours can also be used
independently and combined throughout different
groups to create more contrast and variation
The OpenExO supporting palette consists of Green,
blue and Greyscale palette, providing additional
range to the brand experience. Working with these
colours will yield rich results that marry well with
Primary Colours Palette.

### Typography

The OpenExO identity uses one corporate typography and it is HK Grotesk.
A clean, geometric and humanist typeface that follows the feel of the brand.
It is fundamental to the overrall identity that typefaces decisions are adhered
to across all documents.

#### Core Typography

Exolever primary typeface is HK Grotesk.
Modern, flexible, easy to read, open, and
accessible, HK Grotesk is uniquely suited for a
wide range of visual communications. Multiple
levels of typographic hierarchy are defined both
for impact and clarity of our communications.

Use: internal and external communications,
advertising and marketing communications being
distributed in the form of JPGs, PDFs, PNGs,
TIFFs, or Print Materials.

HK Grotesk is the typography that should be used
for headlines, subheaders, bullet points and
body text.

#### Supporting Typography

The supporting and secondary typeface is
Roboto. It always appears in sentence case
and should only be used for body copy, large
amounts of information, and secondary
information.

#### Alignment & Paragraph Examples

OpenExO typography is usually aligned left. This
provides the eye with a constant starting point
for each line, making text easier to read.

When setting ranged left typography, it is
important to take the time to balance the ragged
edge of the text as effectively as possible. This
improves the legibility and neatness of the
block of text. Also, use sentence case whenever
possible.

IMAGE

### Visual System & Graphic Elements

Giving life to the expression of the OpenExO brand, we have created a visual language to suggest dynamism, energy, movement, progress and transformation. Combined with color and typography, they create a vivid expression for the brand.

#### Visual System

The OpenExO brand has a clear and powerful
visual language for the creation of all the
graphics that accompany the entire brand. This
graphic language is based on the overlapping of
simple geometric shapes. Adding or subtracting
all the shapes can create unique and different
shapes.

IMAGE

#### Shapes Library

Thanks to this visual system we can create infinite
graphic shapes for use in different media. The
Shapes can be used:
- As a container for text (speech bubble)
- As a container for images (frame)
- As a playful element for creating abstract
Illustrations or patterns
- For creating spatial installations

IMAGE

#### Graphic Shapes Examples

The OpenExO Brand Shapes can create a wide
range of backgrounds to accompany texts and
photos.They also help us to create simple visual
concepts.

IMAGE

#### Graphic Geometric Shapes

The OpenExO brand is also based on simple
basic shapes for the creation of textures,
backgrounds and concepts. These shapes
complement the entire visual system of the
brand.

The shapes form the basic elements that make
up the entire visual system: circle, triangle, line,
square and hexagon. All these shapes always have
a rounded finish.

Below are examples of design and development to
create visual concepts and backgrounds.

IMAGE

#### Visual Concepts & Textures

Thanks to these simple geometric shapes, we can
create a multitude of graphics to express visual
concepts. We can use two graphic effects to
follow the visual style of the brand:

##### Ovelapping effect

IMAGE

##### Blend effect (Adobe Illustrator)

IMAGE

#### Visual Concepts & Textures

Also, thanks to these visual effects, we can play
at enlarging these simple shapes and creating
effective backgrounds and textures. We create
a wide range of possibilities to create visual
graphics without losing the basic essence of the
brand and expressing the company’s core values:
Transformation, Energy, Dynamic, Future and
Technology.

IMAGE

### Grid & Layout

The OpenExO grid system maintains a consistent visual identity for the brand. Grids bring order and flexibility to a page. They are the structural foundation for the consistent arrangement of all text and graphic elements. These principles are fundamental to the overall design scheme.

#### Grid

The OpenExO grid system allows for a consistent
visual identity to be maintained across varyng
sizes and types collateral.

Basic Grid density layouts is based on thirds.
Further density of the grid developed form halving
the thirds.

IMAGE

The Grid density serves as the basis for most
layouts and applications. It can be stretched
accordingly for every format.

IMAGE

#### Margins

The grid directly affects the margins. The margins
are based on a ratio of 1/24 of the width of the
communication pieces. If the document is very
narrow, we can use a ratio of 1/12 of the width.

Margins are constant and apply to all designs with
graphics, shapes, text and logos in both digital
and print applications.

IMAGE

#### Alignment & Placing

Choose a suitable solution for the layout
depending on the context, whether it’s a poster,
a web banner, a flyer etc. Our design principles
provide many options.

### Design Applications

The following pages are an examples of how the identity translates across different media types when applied – showing a dynamic and unique identity that shows Transformation, Energy, Dynamics, Future and Technology.

#### App Icon

The App icon always features the logomark, large
and centerised. The mark is in main colors and
always sits on light backgrounds.
